## Introduction: <a name="introduction"></a>
This program was created by the user https://github.com/cantputgreekletters . It was created for the simple reason of having a not so good electronic drum kit. This is a simple solution that allows the drum kit to have better quality sounds and is easy to give this power to other people with the same issue. It is written in python and the libraries that are being used are:
1. Tkinter for the gui.
2. pygame for midi interaction and for playing the sounds.

Everyone is free to use this program and/or is welcome to contribute on it.

## Known possible limitations: <a name="paragraph1"></a>
-There is no real good way to keep track on when someone closes and opens the hi hat.

If anyone knows how to fix this problem, leave a comment or fix it on a new branch.


## How to use <a name="paragraph2"></a>

### Configuration: <a name="subparagraph1"></a>
When you start the program, head on the button "check input" and use a pad on your e drum kit. On the screen there should be some text which shows the pitch of the pad. The number corresponds to your pad so write it down somewhere.


Next, you need to head on the main menu -> options and insert to the right field your numbers.

After assigning the pitch you can use any custom sound file you want on the field next to the one that you put the number of the pitch.

You can also add your own pad by pressing the "Create" button and filling the fields.
(You can remove it too but the Delete button deletes the last field that you put so be ware!!)

After filling every field press the "Save" Button.

After following these steps you are ready to use the drums!

### Drumming: <a name="subparagraph2"></a>
After you have set up everything go to main menu -> Drum and you should be able to use your electronic drum kit while on this menu. If no sounds play, before anything try to restart the program, if it still doesnt work, check if you mapped everything correctly and if your drums work on the check input page.
Also, if you turned on your drums and/or connected them after starting the program the least that you should do is go to the main menu and re open either the drum section or the check input section. If that doesn't work either you should restart the program or your kit might be problematic.

## Possible Updates: <a name="paragraph3"></a>
1. Better GUI.
2. Animations for the drums.
3. Being able to detect the hi hat closing.
4. Variable sound that is depended from how the user hits the pad.
